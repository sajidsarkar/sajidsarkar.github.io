### Project 1: Predicting House Price
I participated in this [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) to acquire hands-on experience in data exploration, feature engineering, and regression techniques. Random Forest Classifier from scikit-learn was used to predict sales price of houses. <ins>**Root Mean Square Error was reduced down to 0.18063.**</ins><br /><br />

### Project 2: Manufacturing Quality Analytics Dashboard
In this project an interactive dashboard was built and deployed online using Heroku. The application is designed to pull data from manufacturing databased using API and python 'requests' libarary. End users can analyze defect symptoms interactively by modifying the time window and filtering by product lines. There is also a timeline visualization helpful for monitoring status of products as they pass through end of manufacturing line testing stations.<br /><br />
