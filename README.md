### [Project 2: Manufacturing Data Visualization](https://github.com/sajidsarkar/Manufacturing-Dash)
<H4>An Interactive Dashboard for Tracking Products During End of Line Quality Testing</H4>
This interactive dashboard is created as a visualization tool for production managers and supervisors to promptly track finished products as they pass through quality testing stations at the end of manufacturing line. As soon as a product is finished, it is expected to pass through end of line quality testing, packaging and trucking with minimum to zero interruption. Any rework arising during this process should be addressed as soon as possible. Therefore, such a visualization promotes enhanced communication among stakeholders in operations and effective detection of downtime.  <br>
